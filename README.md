Chrissie Miller, the creator of BioFit probiotic supplement, calls it a potential solution for obesity that helps to maintain a healthy weight and improves the quality of life. Considering the rapidly increasing numbers of obesity, health experts estimate that the next pandemic after Covid-19 would be obesity, which would impact billions of people. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), obesity is a complicated medical condition with physical, psychological, and social impacts, common for developed, developing, and undeveloped countries.

 

Nearly 25 years ago, there were 200 million adults and 18 million young children (below five years) struggling with obesity. This number has crossed 300 million individuals within the last few years, with more than 100 million living with obesity-linked conditions. Going through the regional reports shows that women are more likely to experience obesity compared to men, and the problem doesn’t end here.

 

This obesity often leads to diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases, stroke, and some types of cancer, all of which may cause early death.

This high obesity rate also flourished the weight loss industry, and diet pills are among the highest selling products worldwide. While there are hundreds of options available, only a few actually help, one of which is the BioFit probiotic supplement. Compared to other established names, the BioFit supplement is a new addition to these popular weight loss products endorsed by thousands of people. More and more people are switching to this supplement because its unique probiotic formula appears to be a very unusual thing for a weight loss supplement.

 

What is BioFit?

BioFit is a nutritional supplement that uses probiotics to help you lose weight.

Probiotic supplements are more popular than ever. Many people take probiotic supplements daily to support gut health. Probiotics are linked to better immunity, weight loss, and other benefits. You can get probiotics through fermented foods — like yogurt and kefir. Or, you can get probiotics through supplements.

 

BioFit only contains probiotic ingredients. Each serving contains around 6 billion colony forming units (CFUs) of probiotics or about 6 times the probiotics in an average serving of yogurt. The supplement contains multiple strains of probiotics, helping you tackle gut health in different ways.
You can only buy BioFit through GoBioFit.com. Each bottle contains 30 capsules.

 

NaturesFormulas.com makes the supplement. But does BioFit probiotic supplementation really work to boost immunity, manage fat loss and improve digestion? How much weight can you lose with BioFit if taken reguarly? Find out everything you need to know about this supplement today in our review.

 

How Does BioFit Work?

BioFit works similar to any other probiotic supplement: the supplement gives your body the probiotic strains it needs for gut health, and you enjoy various benefits.

Typically, probiotic supplements don’t lead to a significant amount of weight loss on their own. Yes, probiotics can help support weight loss and support immunity — but you still need a significant amount of dieting, exercising, and time to lose weight.

 

The BioFit sales page is filled with people who enjoyed powerful benefits after taking BioFit, including:

-Lose up to 72 pounds of weight with no significant changes to diet and exercise

-Safe with no reported side effects

-Natural probiotic ingredients

-Eat all of your favorite foods while still losing a significant amount of weight.

-Take one capsule per day.

-Backed by 180-day, 100% satisfaction guarantee

 

Some people benefit from probiotics more than others. If you already have healthy intestinal flora, then you’re unlikely to benefit from taking more probiotics. Your gut is already balanced, and you’re operating at peak performance.

 

However, many people have imbalanced gut flora. Toxins in the food could cause it. It could be caused by a stressful lifestyle, obesity, antibiotic medication, and other issues.

What to Expect While Taking BioFit

The BioFit presentation is filled with real life individuals who have lost a significant amount of weight while taking BioFit.

 

One woman claims she lost 72 pounds on BioFit, for example, an insane amount of weight to lose with just a probiotic supplement.

 

That woman described her weight loss as “easy and effortless” because of BioFit. She does not claim to have exercised or dieted at all: she just took BioFit and lost 72 pounds.

Another woman cited on the BioFit product description page describes the formula as “the anti-diet.” That woman claims she does not diet at all: she continues to eat all her favorite foods, but “the weight is just falling off of me.” That woman lost so much weight while taking BioFit that people “keep saying they don’t recognize” her.

 

Finally, one man cited on the sales page claims he struggled with digestive issues and weight gain for years. He decided to take BioFit and noticed immediate health benefits: his love handles disappeared, and he now feels less bloated.

 

BioFit Ingredients
It would help if you were skeptical any time a company promises easy and effective weight loss with no hard work — especially when it’s a probiotic formula instead of a conventional weight loss formula.

 

BioFit contains multiple strains of probiotic bacteria. Here’s what the formula looks like:

-5.75 billion CFUs of probiotic bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis (DE111), Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus Plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium breve

-Other ingredients like vegetable cellulose, maltodextrin, and medium-chain triglycerides

The probiotics in BioFit are similar to the probiotics in other supplements. They’re the most common and popular types of probiotics.

 

Some claim that different strains have different effects. That’s somewhat true. However, all of the probiotics in BioFit perform the same general function: they support digestive health and immunity in various ways. Somehow, this leads to a significant amount of weight loss (72 pounds or more).
 

Where to Buy BioFit Probiotic Pills by Nature’s Formula?

 

BioFit is currently offered at three different price points worth reflecting upon. Before doing so, individuals should first consider their health. For typical digestive issues, one bottle might suffice, however, for the more serious cases that prevent individuals from partaking in their day-to-day tasks, the quantities should be upped. Here are the options to choose from (plus free shipping) from the official website for Nature’s Formulas BioFit Probiotic supplement:

1 Bottle (1-month supply): $69.95 each

3 Bottles (3-month supply): $139.95 each

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS)

Is BioFit Available on Amazon.com?

You cannot get these pills on Amazon, unfortunately. This supplement is available exclusively on the manufacturer’s website to prevent counterfeits. However, you can always find as many pills as you want on the official BioFit website, and they ship anywhere in the world.

 

Who are good candidates for BioFit?

BioFit is for anyone who suspects that their gut health needs revamping. By increasing the presence of good bacteria in the body, several of our bodily organs will naturally recover and achieve balance, promoting an array of benefits. This might also be a great way to make lifestyle choices, as one can think of this process as a way of releasing toxins from the body. With the aforementioned in mind, pregnant and/or nursing mothers and people who are currently taking medication should seek a physician’s opinion prior to proceeding.

 

What is the recommended dose for BioFit?

One BioFit capsule should be taken regularly with a glass of water or as recommended by a physician. Others also ask, is it true that I don’t need to diet or exercise when using BioFit pills? Yes, you don’t need to go on a diet or start exercising when taking BioFit weight loss supplements. This supplement triggers the body’s natural ability to burn as many fats and calories as possible, potentially guaranteeing weight loss regardless of what you eat if taken regularly. Different people have varying capacities for burning fats and losing weight. To this end, it takes some people months to get to their desired weight, while some people can realize significant changes in a few weeks. However, you are guaranteed to lose some weight within the first month — and more as you continue taking the supplements.

 

Are there any concerns regarding BioFit?

The one concern that should be brought to consumers’ attention is that BioFit was manufactured in a facility that also processes milk products. Hence, for those with dairy-related concerns, BioFit should be taken with caution. Another unfortunate fact is with respect to accessibility. BioFit is only available for customers within the U.S. and Canada, thus, international interests will not be fulfilled at this time.

 

Should an appropriate storage method be considered?

As long as BioFit is stored in a cool, dry place, everything will be okay. Normally with probiotics, people have this idea that they need to be refrigerated to keep the strains active, but this supposedly isn’t the case here.

 

How many servings are found per BioFit bottle?

Each BioFit bottle includes 30 servings, a quantity ample for one month.

 

What features does BioFit have?

As far as features go, BioFit supposedly only contains 100% natural and safe ingredients, has been tested for quality and purity by a third-party company, was manufactured in the U.S., in an Food and Drug approved, GMP-certified facility and is vegan-friendly.

 

Is BioFit risk-free?

Yes, BioFit is risk-free to a certain extent. Specifically, it has been protected by a 100%, 90-day money-back guarantee. It is the consumer’s responsibility to contact customer service within 90 days from the purchase date to request a refund. Any complaints made after the allotted time will not be accepted.

 

Final Verdict

In summary, BioFit is a probiotic supplement that starts by improving gut health. This is expected to give rise to healthy weight management, liver, heart and cognitive function to name a few. The way in which Nature’s Formulas has approached poor health has been validated seeing that the gut should not be considered its own entity, but one that has long lasting connections with different bodily systems.

 

What makes this supplement worthy is its ingredients list, as every strain has been studied by the scientific community and have all been accepted as being generally safe. On that note, it is important to mention that this idea of using probiotics as a way to heal bodily functions is still relatively new. That is the main reason why many existing studies only appear to have focused on animal models (with some human models). This is not to say that BioFit is bad, but that more research may be required for solid conclusions. Nonetheless, BioFit meets most of the standard requirements of a probiotic supplement.

 

In closing, it is easy to see how it all connects! You see, probiotic supplements such as BioFit are designed to restore the balance between healthy and unhealthy bacteria. This ensures that the digestive system and metabolism work optimally, consequently ensuring that your body burns as many fats and calories as possible.

 

The idea of ingesting bacteria may sound crazy, but you have been playing host to bacteria all of your life. Besides, this is healthy bacteria — and it offers more benefits than just weight loss. The billions of bacteria in your gut fall under varying species, and some species are more effective for digestion and metabolism than others. BioFit contains seven of the most effective bacteria species in each capsule, ensuring the biggest impact on weight loss.

 

Each BioFit capsule contains more than 40 billion healthy gut bacteria under the following seven species as reviewed above:

Lactobacillus Plantarum: this strain is especially popular for functional foods, and it is known to help ease IBS symptoms. It is also associated with a range of anti-obesity properties.

Lactobacillus Acidophilus: this strain is also highly effective, and it is great for the gut. Its benefits include managing abdominal pain and easing IBS symptoms.

Lactobacillus Casei: this strain is known to have a direct positive impact on obesity, based on lab tests. It also helps with a range of conditions associated with an unhealthy digestive system, including constipation and diarrhea.

Lactobacillus Rhamnosus: this strain helps stabilize the production of leptin, a hormone that regulates hunger and satiety. It also helps the gut break down more fats and calories. It is especially effective in women.

Bacillus Subtilis: this strain also helps with a range of digestive problems, including bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. BioFit uses a patented form of this highly effective strain.

Bifidobacterium Breve: one study found that this particular strain has a direct impact on the user’s overall body mass. It is especially effective for pre-obese people, but it also has positive effects for people who are already obese.

Bifidobacterium Longum: This strain helps the digestive system break down macronutrients. The bacteria also line the intestinal walls, protecting it against bacterial control.

All things considered, it might be a good idea to get in touch with Nature’s Formulas regarding the sources of the strains used, as only one out of the seven appears to be clinically tested and patented. After hearing back from them, individuals should get a better sense as to whether or not the prices are justifiable. Ultimately, we encourage everyone to do their respective research prior to investing, especially considering how different each person is in regard to health.
